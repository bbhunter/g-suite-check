# g-suite-check

Checks if the domains MX records point at G-suite

For a random reason in work i needed to check if all the domains were pointing to a g-suite record.

Knocked this up 

Python3 and needs dnspython3 installed.

put all your domains with no HTTP or HTTPS etc in the doms.txt file and it will check the MX records for you.
